# Pixel-City
Iphone app that uses mapKit and flickr to view geo-tagged photos


In order to properly use the flickr API used in the app an API key must be created throu flickr. 
Create your own config file in the app with a constant for the API key and call it "MY_KEY" so that it can be called by any necessary functions.
